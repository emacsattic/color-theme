;; The color-theme-el package follows the Debian/GNU Linux
;; 'emacsen' policy and byte-compiles its elisp files for each 'emacs
;; flavor' (emacs19, xemacs19, emacs20, xemacs20...).  The compiled
;; code is then installed in a subdirectory of the respective
;; site-lisp directory.  We have to add this to the load-path:
